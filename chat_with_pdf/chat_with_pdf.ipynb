The first few plans focused on growth with strengthening of the manufacturing and industrial sector to form the backbone of the Indian economy. Other principal areas of planning were agriculture, poverty alleviation, employment generation, social development etc. Back in 1991, India saw itself battling its most critical economic and currency crisis ever, but after economic reforms and adopting the policy of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization) Indian economy performed well.

It can be seen in Table 3. The trade balance was negative in all years from 1991 to 2010. It peaked as a percentage of GDP in the years of India’s first post-independence “balance of payments crises” in 1956-57 at 4.8 per cent of GDP, remained in the 3-4 per cent range in the 1960s, rose again as a response to the oil and commodity price increases of the early 1970s and again in that range in the 1980s.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion we can say that Indian economy performed well after 1991 but currently Indian economy going through another turbulent phase. It is hard to believe the fact that, we have definitely grown since 1991 but the main imbalances then -fiscal deficit and current account deficit- are in reckoning again and have become the main concerns of today. People have started drawing parallels based on similarities in the economy like Current Account Deficit in 2012 is 4% as compared to 3% of 1991. Fiscal Deficit is 6% in 2012 as compared 8% in 1991.'), Document(metadata={'document_id': 'd44b313c-e96a-4ca8-933d-788fb5f6f03b'}, page_content='ECONOMIC PROGRESS POST-1991\\n\\nThe initiation of economic reforms in the 1990s saw India gradually breaking free of the low growth trap which was euphemistically called the “Hindu growth rate” of 3.5 per cent per annum. Real GDP growth averaged 5.7 per cent per annum in the 1990s, which accelerated further to 7.3 per cent per annum in 2000s. A feature of the growth acceleration during the period was that while the growth rate of industry and services increased that of agriculture fell. This was because there was no notable technological breakthrough after the “green revolution” of the mid-1960s which saw sharp increase in yields of cereal production particularly in northern part of India. By the 1990s, the momentum of “green revolution” had died down. Consequently, the yield increases in the 2000s were much lower than those experienced even in the 1990s.

            "* **Economic Reforms:** In 1991, India faced a major economic crisis, leading to the adoption of liberalization, privatization, and globalization (LPG) policies. These reforms aimed to open up the economy to foreign investment and competition, and reduce the role of the government.\n",

            "* **Post-Liberalization (1991-2010):**  The trade balance remained negative throughout this period, suggesting India's imports consistently exceeded its exports.  The deficit, however, varied from year to year.  \n",
            "* **Growth and Challenges (1991-2010):**  While the Indian economy performed well after 1991, the text highlights that the imbalances of the past, particularly the current account deficit, resurfaced and became a concern.  The text specifically mentions that the current account deficit in 2012 was 4%, similar to the 3% seen in 1991.\n",

            "**Key Points:**\n",
